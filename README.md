WEB-APP START UP

The project is structured into two main directories:

- front-end
- back-end
  
The front-end is built with React and runs on port 3001. To set up the front-end, navigate to the front-end folder, install the necessarydependencies using npm install command, and start thedevelopment server with npm start command.
The back-end is developed using Node.js and Express, operating on port 5000. For the back-end, move to the back-end directory, install dependencies by running npm install command, and start the server using node server.js command. Ensure that Node.jsand npm are installed on your system before running theapplication.
The front-end communicates with the back-end through a RESTful API, enabling seamless data management.
